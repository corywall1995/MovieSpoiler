          Voil√†! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both
          victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere
          veneer of vanity, is it vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished.
          However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified,
          and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice
          and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.
          The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain,
          for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant
          and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose
          so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you, and you may
          call me V.

          Remember, remember, the fifth of November, The gunpowder treason and
          plot. I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.

        V for Vendetta is a movie about a post WWIII Great Britain where a facist
        government has taken control. This facist government, lead by Chancellor
        Sulter, starts doing Nazi-like experimentation on the people they deem unfit
        for society (aka Jews, Muslims, homosexuals, etc.) and eventually these
        experiments yeild the worlds most deadly virus that the government then uses
        on its own people. They were able to create a vaccine for the virus from
        the blood of one of the prisoners, the prisoner from cell 5
        <span class="spoil-protect">(roman numeral V).</span> Though this prisoner
        was immune from the virus, once he was exposed to it he lost his memory,
        he could no longer remember who he was or where he was from, so he takes
        the name <span class="spoil-protect">"V" (his cell number).</span> One day,
        on November 5th, the lab where they were performing these
        experiments had an accident where the whole facility went up in flames, none
        of the prisoners survived... except the prisoner from cell 5. <span class="spoil-protect">The prisoner
        now burned and scared from the accident wears a Guy Fawkes mask and a robe
        to hides these injuries and dedicates his life to getting revenge against
        the facist goverment, its leaders, and those in charge of he detention facility.
        He eventually gets his revenge and is successful in toppling the governemnt,
        and killing the people in charge of the detention facility where he was held,
        however in doing so V was killed. His body was loaded on board a train full of
        explosives bound for parliment.</span>
